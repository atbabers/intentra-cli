### Adding Support for a New Tool

1. Create `internal/hooks/normalizer_<tool>.go` implementing the `Normalizer` interface
2. Register the normalizer in `init()` with `RegisterNormalizer()`
3. Add tool constants to `internal/hooks/manager.go`
4. Add hook JSON template to `internal/hooks/templates.go`
5. Add tests in `internal/hooks/*_test.go`
6. Update documentation

## Coding Standards

### Go Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` for formatting (enforced by CI)
- Run `golangci-lint` before submitting

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all exported functions and types

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```

- Implement normalizer for XYZ event format
- Add hook installation for XYZ config location
- Update documentation
```

Prefixes:
- `feat:` New feature
